# asteroid-mining-simulation
This is an asteroid mining simulation application  
The project has two branches: the main branch and the h5Version branch.   
If you are on **main** branch, please run: *npm run dev:weapp*  
If you are on **h5Version** branch, please run: *npm run dev:h5*  
After research, I found that the library socket.io-client does not support WeChat Mini Program. Therefore, for the steps after step 1 in the requirements, I implement it using H5.
